Hello my sweet dear child,

This is your dad :)

I am writing this here because I wanted something that will always be close to remind you how much i love you, 
and how much i wish for your education to be a positive experience.

This world can be scary, it can be hard to find relationships, to find joy in the small things, you will struggle with feelings of being alone,
you will see all manners of hardship.

But I want to remind you always- you are capable, you are kind, and you are a good soul.
Rememeber always to find joy in the things that god has given us, this world is magic and we should always remeber not to take it for granted. 

Do your best to always explore all manners of knowledge,
always remember our goal is to help others, and to grow in love,
never scorn someone else for knowing less then you.

You are the pride of my life,
Strive to create, 
You were made to make beautiful things my dear.

Let no one rule your mind or body. Take special care that your thoughts remain unfettered...
Give men your ear, but not your heart. 
Show respect for those in power, but don't follow them blindly.
Judge with logic and reason, but comment not. 
Consider none your superior whatever their rank or station in life.
Treat all fairly. 
Be careful with your money. 
Hold fast to your beliefs and others will listen.
Of the affairs of love... my only advice is to be honest. 
Thats your most powerfull too to unlock a heart or gain forgiveness.
Do what is right not what is easy.
Live with a soul un-tempered.

I love you my dear.
Live well.
